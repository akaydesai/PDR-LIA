 Here is the final version of the project code, report and documentation. The 
PDR implementation now uses one frame per solver and we have tried to maximize 
the use of push/pop features to maximize incremental solving.

 We have also tried our best to document the constituent code for posterity. 
To access the it without reading the source, run doxygen in this directory. 
Then, simply open the "namespaces.html" file in the "html" directory. For
details on how to run the script, on the namespaces page, click on "pdr".
